# Multi Purpose GUI - Reference Manual

## Introduction

MPGUI (Multi Purpose GUI) is a graphical frontend for various command-line based tools such as Lightwaves TESAnnwyn or TES4qLOD or [tes4ll](https://github.com/Gruftikus/tes4ll). 
In order to be flexible for possible new versions of each of the tools, MPGUI does not use hard coded elements, 
but it is based on a scripting language (Multi Purpose Batch, or just “batch”). In fact the [syntax](https://github.com/Gruftikus/lltool/wiki/Batch-Syntax) is the same as used for tes4ll/lltool.

This manual describes the GUI-syntax of the batch files (*.mpb).
